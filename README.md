# SASS & Maintainable CSS

### A thundertalk about Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets by Paul & Kai!

## Contents

**Why using SASS?**

Writing a lot of CSS can be overwhelming and hard to maintain. Thanks to this CSS pre–processor, it’s now possible to write DRY CSS code and allows you to declare variables and «some» other features that can be re-used all throughout the style.

**How to CSS with SASS**

Sass provides higher level style syntax and takes your preprocessed SASS file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your web site. Basically, you write 60lines of SASS and this will generate a couple hundred lines of prefectly written CSS. Voila!

**Beautiful syntax**

* SASS is a space sensitive way to write CSS and uses indentation instead of { } to delimit code blocks.
* Everything that would be within { and } after a statement must be on a new line and indented one level deeper than the statement
* Tabs and spaces are not the same even if they look the same!

**Meaningfull features**

SASS comes with a set of additional features to write your generate your CSS  such as Variables,
Nesting, Mixins, Property inheritance, Operators... And much more by combining those five together.

**SASS in Rails**

Rails compile .sass files for you, all you need is to change .scss file estention to .sass, and write your SASS!

## Notes

**CSS** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

**SCSS** Sass 3 introduces a new syntax known as SCSS which is fully compatible with the syntax of CSS, while still supporting the full power of Sass.

**SASS** Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

**LESS** Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. (Just like SASS but for JavaScript!)
